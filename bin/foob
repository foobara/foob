# How to parse for generate calls?
# generate as the "action" and "g" as the short-cut. Should look at CLI connector implementation for ideas.

# Make generators register themself with Foobara for use here?

# Usage: foob g domain-project -f SomeOrg::SomeDomain ../some-org-some-domain
# detect that it's g... find generator with that name, somehow use cli command connector execute it.
